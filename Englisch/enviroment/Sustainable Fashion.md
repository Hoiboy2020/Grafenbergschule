1. Different approaches to slow fashion
	1. Reselling:
		- online platforms gain more traction, while the sale of clothes in retail stores declines
		- Huge increase in Sales on Websites like Loopster
		- Selling old clothes offers alternatives to throwing them into the trash
		- Retail stores are getting a lot of clothes but no one is buying them
		- New websites loan out clothes to prevent the effects of fast fashion
		- It is overall cheaper to buy secondhand than to buy new clothes
	2. Repairing
		+ e.g. Sojo works like a delivery service for clothes repairs and alterations. Costumers connected to local seamster businesses through app and bike delivery service
	3. Swishing
		+ e.g. Nuw and Swopped: people can swap fashion items via their mobile phones - users earn an equal value token for each item they swap, so no need to exchange directly with another user
