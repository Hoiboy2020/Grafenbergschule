The article _“Rampant destruction of forests ‘will unleash more pandemics’”_, which was written by _The Guardian_ and published on the 30th of August 2020, talks about the problems that come with the destruction of forests with a focus on diseases. 

The article emphasizes that deforestation is mainly driven by human activities such as industrial farming, cattle ranching, logging, mining, and the construction of roads and settlements. Tropical rainforests, in particular, are affected, even though they are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. These forests normally help regulate disease by keeping animal species separated and maintaining stable ecosystems. When this balance is disrupted, pathogens that were once contained in wildlife populations can spread more easily.

Furthermore, the article refers to several past outbreaks, including Ebola, SARS, and Covid-19, to show how closely environmental destruction and global health are connected. Scientists and experts quoted in the text warn that pandemics are not random events but a predictable consequence of how humans exploit nature. The destruction of forests also leads to climate change, which further weakens ecosystems and can increase the spread of disease by changing temperatures and rainfall patterns.

In addition to the environmental and health risks, the article discusses the social and economic consequences of deforestation. Indigenous communities lose their homes and livelihoods, while global society faces rising healthcare costs and economic instability caused by pandemics. The article concludes by arguing that protecting forests is essential not only to preserve biodiversity and fight climate change, but also to reduce the risk of future pandemics. A more sustainable relationship between humans and nature is presented as a necessary step to protect both the planet and human health.
